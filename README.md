# MachineLearningExercises
Here you'll find the 2 homeworks that I've developed during my Machine Learning MSC
The development process has been heavily based on libraries such as:
 - HW1: pandas, numpy & sklearn;
 - HW2: keras & tensorflow.
<br/>
<br/>

ABSTRACT HW1<br/>
The task that we have been assigned was to analyze a JSON file populated with a
dictionary containing several Assembly Instructions related to different kinds of
functions that usually are exploited to create malwares.
Our job was to define and implement several Classification Models in order to
successfully classify the various functions based on the analysis of the given dataset.
Moreover we had 4 possible functions:
- Encryption
- Math
- Sort
- String

Finally, after evaluating our models we were asked to perform a blind test prediction on
another JSON file that had only the set of instructions, leaving blank the ground truth.

ABSTRACT HW2<br/>
The task that we have been assigned was to analyze a custom dataset generated
randomly from our student id. We were assigned 8 different classes all containing
different images, gathered from the Bing Search Engine that had to be classified by our
model.
Our job was to define and implement any kind of Machine Learning to deal with the
task. Given the fact that we were working with images, considering also the subject
covered during the second part of the course I decided to approach this task using
Neural Network, specifically Convolutional ones.
Moreover those were the 8 classes assigned to me:
- Blueberries,
- Energy Drink,
- Honey,
- Latex Gloves,
- Vegetable Chips & Crisps,
- Accent Plate,
- Grocery Bag,
- Plastic Knife.
